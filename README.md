# PAYCHECK
The goal of this application is to assist you in
        calculating how much money you will receive in each
        paycheck after taxes have been deducted.
        You have to know the total deduction removed such as CCP,EI,Tax 
        which can always be seen on your paystub
        and again this is designed for bi-weekly pay 
        and I use the 'max_week to specifically show that we can only work 
        maximum of two weeks.1 means first week and 2 means second week.
        So, when you are asked how many weeks you have to choose only 1 or 2.
